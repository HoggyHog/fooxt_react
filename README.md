# INTRO

This was a project invloves using React-Redux on the frontend and Firebase in the backend to create a Full-Stack E-Commerce Website. Used Tailwind CSS for having pre-custom
classes for styling the web page and also for making it responsive to multiple view ports

## Framer Motion

Library used to incorporate animations in the website making it more interactive

## Netlify

I used [netlify](netlify.com) for the hosting. All I had to do was upload the build files into the local server machine.
